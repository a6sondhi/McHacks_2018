    <p>  Welcome to the Immerse Web Application. Over the past 30 years, the
            percentage American adults who read
            literature has dropped about 14%. The issue we discovered is that due to the rise of modern technologies, movies
            and other films are more captivating than reading
            a boring book.
            That is way we came up with Immerse.
            By utilizing IBM Watson and the Spotify's API, Immerse reads in text, analyzes the emotion,
            and plays music accordingly to the atmosphere inspired by the literature. Text is brought to life and readers
            can feel more immersed into
            their novels. Users can either scan text through their mobile devices or simply input the text through this web
            app.
